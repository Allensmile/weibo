Analyze China's post-80s generation using Weibo
=====

This is the code I used for my project of mining [Weibo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo), the popular Chinese microblogging service, to analyze the mentality of young Chinese (i.e., the post-80s). The project and the results are documented [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/09/analyzing-chinas-post-80s.html).

Included are both the Python code used for scraping the users and their tweets from the website and the R code used for the analysis.
